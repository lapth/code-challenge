# Problem
Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n

# Solutions
When solving this problem, you may focus on algorithmic efficiency. However, beyond the solutions themselves, I want to highlight real-world scenarios where these approaches are applicable in projects.

For this reason, I present **two formal solutions**:

1. A **standard approach**, which follows a common iterative method.
2. The **optimal approach**, which utilizes a mathematical formula for efficiency.

For the third solution, I want to emphasize that sometimes, instead of implementing everything manually, we can leverage well-established libraries. This can save development time, reduce errors, and optimize performance.

# My solutions
You can find my implementations in the `sum.ts` file.

    No configuration files or execution guidelines are provided, as this is a conceptual solution rather than an executable program.

Thank you!
